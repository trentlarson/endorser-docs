... to show gratitude

How can we share with someone a signed record of seeing them, revealing our gratitude such that they can see and appreciate the recognition but without making it fully public?

  * Declare an "Event" about an "agent", with a "description" of what happened. Technically: `Event by Bio Vocabulary <https://vocab.org/bio/#event>`_

**Other References**

* Here are other schema possibilities:

  * There are others at LOV like `"appreciate" <https://lov.linkeddata.es/dataset/lov/terms?q=appreciate>`_ or `"observe" <https://lov.linkeddata.es/dataset/lov/terms?q=observe>`_ but they are no longer active.

  * `"WatchAction" by schema.org <https://schema.org/WatchAction>`_ is meant for watching media (eg. a movie).

  * `"Observation" by the W3c Sensor Ontology <https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-ssn/#SOSAObservation>`_ is close but meant for mechanical devices.

  * `"Witness" by the Library of Congress <https://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/wit.html>`_ is for voices in media.

Someday we'll allow for encrypted content, so that only the recipient will be able to see the statement.

Note that the open nature of these descriptions allow for negative expressions as well; that feedback is usually more appropriate in different channels. Someday we hope to provide ways for individuals to filter such things, but for now we simply recognize that there are infinite ways to abuse others and we won't proactively shut down channels, prefering to allow freedom and deal with it when the problem arises.
