Membership and Pledges
======================

How can we show that someone has authorization, or has shown agreement to conditions?

Here are a few scenarios:

1. I want to take a pledge about policing.

1. I want to record membership for my users.

The specific verbs used in these are "Accept" & "Agree", along with a text description of the pledge. Technically: schema.org `"AcceptAction" <https://schema.org/AcceptAction>`_ and `"AgreeAction" <https://schema.org/AgreeAction>`_

So we can apply that to the scenarios above, available in the app:

1. Sign a pledge commitment (which creates an "AcceptAction").

1. Agree with someone else's membership claim (which creates an "AgreeAction" with their "OrganizationRole").

To get confirmation from people other than youself, search in the app for those with the right authority. If you cannot see the details, ask others personally for a connection... you need to be connected somehow.

Pledges are used in multiple organizations:

  - The `Developer Certificate of Origin <https://developercertificate.org/>`_ is a pledge that the developer created their contribution, and git projects can enforce that pledge, eg. at `GitHub <https://github.com/apps/dco>`_.

  - The `Thick Red Line <https://thickredline.org/>`_ aims to build membership inside police departments with a simple pledge (regarding victimless crimes -- see `page 3 here <https://thickredline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/The_Police_and_Sheriffs_Dept_Starter_Pack_Handbook-1.pdf>`_).
